# The Law


The law is a framework of rules we all have to abide by.  
These laws have been written over decades mostly by our rulers but also indirectly by citizens at times.  
France has 15,500 laws, 127,000 decrees, 7400 treaties, and 17,000 EU laws [[1]](#1). And that's fairly average, the US has around the same number of federal laws.  
But the truth is we often don't even know how many laws there are in the US and many other countries, we just have estimates. It's that bad.  
And this is a problem because there is a rule saying `Ignorantia juris non excusat` [[2]](#2) which states:

<blockquote>
Ignorantia juris non excusat[1] or ignorantia legis neminem excusat[2] (Latin for "ignorance of the law excuses not"[1] and "ignorance of law excuses no one"[2] respectively) is a legal principle holding that a person who is unaware of a law may not escape liability for violating that law merely because one was unaware of its content.

European-law countries with a tradition of Roman law may also use an expression from Aristotle translated into Latin: nemo censetur ignorare legem (nobody is thought to be ignorant of the law) or ignorantia iuris nocet (not knowing the law is harmful). 
</blockquote>

So nobody should ignore the law, and you can't blame your actions on your ignorance, but at the same time nobody knows all the laws.  
The framework is a big pile of spaghetti code that is super hard to maintain and contains a lot of legacy code, often conflicting each other.

That's why I made this repository. As I don't want to go to jail and be detained I want to know my rights and what I should and shouldn't do as much as possible.  
This repository will be a collection of tips and laws so that you can protect yourself. Laws can be turned to your advantage if you know how to play with them.

# Can I contribute?

Sure! Feel free to make a PR and add more laws for any country. There is only one important thing, please source everything you say as much as possible. Ideally government sources if possible or a good authority I know it's not always easy to find though.
