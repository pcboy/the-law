## Interesting office laws

You can use the following laws at your advantage at the office.

- It's illegal to eat lunch at your desk at work.  
Article R4228-19 du Code du travail [[1]](#1)  
If your company has at least 50 employees, they have to give you a place where you can eat ([Article R4228-22](#3)). And it has to have a sufficient amount of tables and chairs, a faucet with drinking water available, cold AND hot, a fridge, and something to heat your food (like a microwave).  
Under 50 employees they still have to give you a place to eat but the restrictions on chairs and tables are not as strict.  
If your employer does not provide this and refuse to, feel free to sue, you'll win.  
You can also use that law at your advantage is your boss forces you to eat your lunch in front of your computer to make your work longer without pause.

- You can be fired if your mood is incompatible with the rest of the team. [[2]](#2)

- You can drink alcohol at work but only wine, beer, cider, poir√©, anything else is forbidden (so no hard liquors). And you can't be drunk (whatever that means).  Article R4228-20 [[4]](#4) and R4228-21 [[5]](#5) du Code du travail  
If you are being socially forced to drink at work to the point of being drunk, you can sue. Be sure to keep proofs that you are drunk, which is difficult but I suppose an Ethylotest result could work.
