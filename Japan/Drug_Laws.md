Actual source of the law:  
[Japan_Anti_Drug_Special_Provisions_Law_1991 [PDF]](./assets/Japan_Anti_Drug_Special_Provisions_Law_1991.pdf)

<blockquote>
(Incitement or Solicitation) Article 9. Any person who publicly incites or solicits others to commit any drug offense (except for offenses specified in the preceding article and this article) or any offense specified in Article 6 or Article 7 or to abuse any controlled substance shall be imprisoned with hard labor not exceeding three years or fined not more than five hundred thousand yen. 
</blockquote>

Interestingly:  

<blockquote>
2. Any person who with intent to commit any drug offense (limited to those involving transfer, receipt or possession of any controlled substance) transfers to or receives from another person any drug or other article as a controlled substance or possesses any drug or other article that the said person has received or acquired as a controlled substance, shall be imprisoned with hard labor not exceeding two years or fined not more than three hundred thousand yen.
</blockquote>

So it's actually worse to talk about drugs online and inciting others to use drugs than to actually posessing/exchanging some, 3 years jail time max for the former, 2 years for the latter.  
Free speech has its limits as you can see, so be careful of what you say online..
