# Foreigners' Rights

## McLean v Minister of Justice, 1978

The McLean case is an interesting case setting a precedent in Japan that a foreigner can lose their residency rights if they take part in a demonstration.  
The full case is here:  

http://www.yoshabunko.com/citizenship/McLean_v_MOJ_1978.html

To be more precise, McLean was refused renewal of his visa because of his anti Vietnam war protests.  

We learn a few things from this case.  
- Only Japanese have the _right_ to enter, be in, and remain in Japan. (somehow it's relevant to the covid 19 pandemic too, where foreigners with PR could not come back).  
- We learn that there is a difference between 国民 (national) and 日本国民 (Japanese national).  
- The Minister of Justice is free to refuse renewal of permission to be in Japan so long as there are no grounds for reversing the refusal. 
- Courts assume that a decision made by an agency of the state, using its discretionary power, is reasonable, and hence the burden of proof is on an appellant to prove otherwise. 
- The status of being a foreign national ipso facto limits the parameters of any freedoms the constitution may guarantee a person.
- The status of being a Japanese national confers on a person a somewhat different set of rights and duties of citizenship.  
- *The discretionary power of the state is supreme to whatever human rights the constitution may guarantee foreign nationals. *  

Morale of the story, be careful not to be involved in anything political, avoid confrontations at all costs, you don't have many rights as a foreigner, they can be overturned easily.

## Foreigners rights  

> Paragraph 1 of Article 14 of the Constitution provides that "all of the people are equal under the law and there shall be no discrimination in political, economic or social relations because of race, creed, sex, social status or family origin," guaranteeing equality before the law without any discrimination, including either racial or ethnic discrimination, which is the subject of this Convention. Foreign residents in Japan are also guaranteed fundamental human rights under the Constitution except the rights which, owing to their nature, are interpreted to be applicable only to Japanese nationals (*1).

>    *1 In this report, the fact that the treatment of foreigners in Japan has been focused on does not mean that Japan considers distinction based on nationality as the subject of the Convention.

Education and housing:

>  With regard to education, for example, Japan guarantees equal rights to education and equal treatment (no tuition fees, free textbooks, etc.) for the children of foreign nationals who wish to study at public schools for compulsory education. Employment exchange service is also provided to all people without racial or ethnic discrimination. Moreover, discriminatory treatment with regard to labor conditions based on nationality is prohibited and punishable by law. Furthermore, public housing is available for foreign nationals as well as Japanese nationals as long as they register their domicile and identity at the municipalities of their residence. Social security is also granted on the basis of the principle of equality regardless of nationality. For example, the nationality requirement for joining the National Pension and the National Health Insurance as well as for receiving Child Allowance and Child-Rearing Allowance has been abolished. In addition, permanent residents and settled residents residing in Japan in the same way as Japanese nationals can be provided, as an administrative measure, public assistance under conditions identical to those of Japanese nationals. (See Article 5.)

> (1) Yokohama District Court, 19 June 1974, Judgment of the Second Division of the Civil Court
> A Korean resident in Japan, in fear of not being employed if his nationality was known, kept secret the fact that he was a Korean resident and entered instead a Japanese name under name and birth place on his curriculum vitae and on the report on his family, which he submitted in applying for employment. He was informally employed by the Japanese company, but later dismissed according to the employer's reserved cancellation right on the grounds of false statement. The Court ruled that the dismissal, which was made on the grounds of his being a Korean resident without any other rational reason, constitutes unfair conduct according to Article 3 of the Labor Standards Law and Article 90 of the Civil Code. The Court ordered damage compensation to be paid for the mental anguish inflicted on the plaintiff due to ethnic discrimination. 

=> You can't be fired for using a fake name on your resume if the goal is to hide your foreigness.

> (2) Osaka District Court, 18 June 1993, Judgment of the Seventeenth Division of the Civil Court
> 	A Korean resident in Japan who applied for tenancy agreed on the lease with a real estate agent, but the owner refused to conclude the contract mainly on the grounds that he was a Korean resident. The Court ruled that this was in violation of the dignity of the individual (Article 1, Paragraph 2, the Civil Code) in the preliminary contract stage, and ordered compensation for damages according to Article 709 of the Civil Code.

This one is particularly interesting as it happens regularly in Japan. It's the proof that if you sue, you'll win. If you have the courage, please sue.

> (a) A real estate agency refused a foreigner the right to lease an apartment asking him/her to "refrain from leasing at the owner's request". According to the investigation into the matter conducted by the human rights organ of the Ministry of Justice, however, this was confirmed as an act of discrimination against foreigners in the lease of an apartment based on prejudice against them. The real estate agency was asked to reconsider its attitude considering the explanation that such acts could not be overlooked under human rights protection, in accordance with the purpose of the respect of fundamental human rights under Articles 13 and 14 of the Constitution, and also in consideration of Japan's responsibility as a contracting country to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. As a consequence, the real estate agency expressed regret for the said act and promised that they would endeavor to obtain an appropriate understanding of issues regarding foreigners. (The result of the disposition was "explanation".)



>	(b) A village which received a report that a girl had been touched by a foreign visitor at a public swimming pool in the village , decided to restrict foreigners' use of the pool, and put up notices stating "Foreign visitors are prohibited from using the swimming pool at this time".
The human rights organs of the Ministry of Justice explained to the persons of the village responsible for this decision that such a measure discriminating against foreigners in general was in violation of the Constitution of Japan and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as well as the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, and they could not overlook such discrimination in the light of the protection of human rights. And they required the village to withdraw the decision and the notices immediately. As the result, the village accordingly withdrew them. (The result of the disposition was "elimination measures".)

This one is also good to know as you'll find in some cases bars who refuses foreigners. At least if they have a clear notice on their door you can take a picture as proof and sue them, you'll win it seems.

# Zainichi Koreans rights  

> The Constitution guarantees the human rights of these people as mentioned before, although they do not have the rights that are not applicable to foreign nationals such as suffrage or freedom of entry into Japan, because they do not have Japanese nationality. Thus, Korean residents in Japan are basically treated in the same way as other foreign residents under the domestic law. However, in light of their historical background and their permanent living conditions, the Government has taken various measures so that these people can have a stable life in Japan. 

Again they don't have the same rights as Japanese nationals on paper.

Special conditions for deportation of special permanent residents (e.g Zainichis):  
> The reasons for deportation for special permanent resident are restricted to the extreme minimum to further stabilize the legal status of the special permanent residents: the reasons are restricted to crimes concerning insurrection and foreign aggression; crimes concerning foreign relations (damage or destruction of foreign flag, etc., preparation and plots for private war, violation of neutrality ordinances); crimes affecting diplomatic relations (violence and defamation of the heads of foreign states or diplomatic missions); and, crimes gravely harming national interests (the violation of the Explosive Control Act for the purpose of destroying the democratic judicial order, homicide, or arson). So far no one has been deported for the aforementioned reasons set out in Article 9 of the Immigration Control Special Law. 

So you can be deported as a Zainichi, which is quite interesting. You would be deported to Korea even if you never set foot there.  
Why bother at this point and not simply put them in jail I'm not sure. But as mentioned it seems it has never actually be put in practice.  

Employment:  
> With regard to employment exchange and labor conditions, discriminatory treatment on the basis of race or nationality is strictly prohibited. The Government, for the sake of Korean residents in Japan, makes efforts to instruct and enlighten employers by conducting public relations activities to provide a proper understanding and recognition of equal employment opportunities and by giving individual guidance to companies engaged in improper businesses.


# Freedom of Speech

> As is clear from Japan's reservation to the said Convention regarding all dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred, there are no specific provisions that stipulate what constitutes racially discriminatory expression, that is, dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred, as a criminal act, considering the importance of the freedoms of assembly, association and expression as guaranteed by the Constitution. However, if the content damages the honor or credit of a specific individual or group, such dissemination of ideas is punishable as a crime of defamation (Article 230, Penal Code), insult (Article 231), or damage to credit, obstruction of business (Article 233) of the Penal Code. If such activities include threatening contents against a specific individual, they are punishable as a crime of intimidation (Article 222), collective intimidation and habitual intimidation (Article 1 and Article 1-3 of the Law concerning Punishment of Physical Violence and Others).

The freedom of speech is pretty well preserved in a sense a racist can speak freely. But, if your honor is damaged you can sue for defamation. It's quite unclear how you would give a proof that your _honor_ is damaged, but it's worth a try. You can also sue if that affects your business. Seems pretty fair and good to know.

> Incitement to racial discrimination is punishable as a crime of instigation (Article 61,Penal Code) or assistance (Article 62) of the crimes if an act constitutes one of the above-mentioned crimes. If an instigation or assistance in a violation of a law prohibiting discriminatory treatment, such as the provision of equal treatment by public officials (Articles 27 and 109 of the National Public Service Law, Articles 13 and 60 of the Local Public Service Law), is also punished.

Incitation of racial discrimination is also punishable.


> In relation to Article 4 of the Convention, there were a number of incidents of harassment and assaults against the Korean students across Japan from the spring to the summer of 1994. They included discriminatory words and behavior against female students of Korean schools, discriminatory graffiti in railway station restrooms and incidents of assault by ripping chima chogori (Korean ethnic dress), to all of which the Government paid great attention in the light of the protection of human rights.
The police attempted to arrest the offenders quickly and to prevent further these incidents from happening by reinforcing patrols in possible trouble areas during commuting hours with the close teamwork of the related authorities and the cooperation of schools. 


# Immigration control  

> Article 4 of the Administrative Appeal Law sets out the cases in which an appeal is not permitted. One such case is the disposition regarding the entry and departure of foreigners (Item 10, Paragraph 1, Article 4, the Administrative Appeal Law). However, Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act has the following system of filing complaints. Foreigners who are subject to this system can cite unfairness and can call for reconsideration in making a complaint about the discriminatory disposition based on differences of race or ethnicity.

> (1) Landing procedures (a foreigner recognized as not meeting landing requirements by the special inquiry officer can file an objection with the Minister of Justice.)

> (2) Deportation procedures (a foreigner whose deportation is deemed appropriate by the immigration inspector can request a hearing to the inquiry officer. Moreover, if the special inquiry officer judges that the immigration inspector was not mistaken, the foreigner can file an objection with the Minister of Justice.)

> (3) Refugee recognition procedures (a foreigner whose application for refugee recognition was rejected or whose refugee status was revoked can file an objection with the Minister of Justice.)
